# RorPlanner â€” UI scaffold

This repository contains an initial React + TypeScript scaffold for RorPlanner. It includes separated components for the toolbar, equipment grid, slot cards, item picker modal, and stats panel.

Quick start (PowerShell):

```powershell
npm install
npm run dev
```

This creates a minimal skeleton. Next steps: wire Apollo/GraphQL, fetch careers/items, and implement tooltips and talisman slots.
